# image-processing-for-particle-size_ Using_MATLAB
The particle size of the raw material i.e. iron ore, coal, and dolomite are measured frequently in order to maintain the particle size distribution of the input material which has some direct and indirect effects on the quality of the produced sponge iron.

Image processing is a subcategory of digital signal processing which is used to remove noise and signal irregularities followed by generating data from the digital image for future analysis (moisture prediction). Currently, it is used to predict particle size distribution in coal from the image using image analysis through MATLAB.
